Function of design.md in the Spec-Driven Development Process
The design.md file serves as the technical architecture blueprint that bridges the gap between user requirements and actionable implementation tasks. Here's its specific function:

üèóÔ∏è Primary Purpose
The design document translates high-level requirements into detailed technical specifications, providing developers with the architectural foundation needed to implement the feature correctly.

üìã Key Functions
1. Technical Architecture Definition
System Design: Defines the overall architecture, component relationships, and data flow
Technology Stack: Specifies exact tools, libraries, and frameworks to be used
Component Hierarchy: Maps out how UI components interact and depend on each other
2. Implementation Guidance
Code Examples: Provides TypeScript interfaces, component structures, and implementation patterns
Design Patterns: Specifies architectural patterns (state management, error handling, performance optimization)
Technical Constraints: Defines performance requirements, browser support, and accessibility standards
3. Requirements-to-Code Translation
Requirement Mapping: Shows how each requirement translates into specific technical components
Design Decisions: Explains why certain technical approaches were chosen
Integration Points: Defines how different parts of the system work together
4. Quality Assurance Framework
Testing Architecture: Provides the technical foundation for comprehensive testing
Performance Specifications: Defines measurable performance targets (60fps, <2s load time)
Accessibility Implementation: Specifies technical approaches for WCAG compliance

‚úÖ Quality Characteristics
The design document ensures the implementation will meet all five critical characteristics:

Usability: Component design promotes discoverability and ease of use
Functionality: Architecture ensures reliable clipboard operations and data persistence
Navigability: Technical specifications enable efficient keyboard navigation
Responsiveness: Performance optimization strategies maintain smooth UI across devices
Accessibility: Detailed accessibility implementation ensures WCAG AAA compliance
üîß For Developers
The design.md serves as the single source of truth for:

What technologies to use and how to configure them
How components should be structured and interact
What performance targets to meet and how to achieve them
How to implement accessibility and testing requirements
This ensures that when developers begin implementing tasks from tasks.md, they have a clear, comprehensive technical roadmap that will result in a high-quality, well-architected application that meets all specified requirements.
