# üîí SANDRO Application Requirements

## üéØ Problem Statement
The SANDRO web application currently exposes all code, assets, and business logic through browser developer tools, making intellectual property vulnerable to easy discovery and replication by competitors.

## üë• Target Users
- **Developers**: Need to protect proprietary code and algorithms
- **Business Owners**: Require competitive advantage protection  
- **Content Creators**: Want to secure premium assets and 3D models

## üèÜ Success Vision
Transform the application from "discoverable in 30 seconds" to requiring "3+ minutes of expert investigation" for reverse engineering, significantly reducing competitive copying risk.

---

## üìã FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

### Requirement 1: JavaScript Code Protection

**User Story:** As a developer, I want my JavaScript code to be unreadable and non-discoverable, so that competitors cannot easily steal my proprietary algorithms and business logic.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN production build is generated THEN bundle files SHALL have randomized names (e.g., `a7d82f.js`)
2. WHEN user opens browser dev tools THEN library names SHALL NOT be visible in console or network requests  
3. WHEN code is viewed in dev tools THEN variable names SHALL be mangled to single characters
4. WHEN production is deployed THEN source maps SHALL NOT be generated or served
5. WHEN JavaScript executes THEN console.log statements SHALL be completely stripped

#### Success Metrics
- Discovery time increases from <30 seconds to >3 minutes
- Code readability reduced by >90% through obfuscation
- Zero source maps accessible in production

### Requirement 2: Asset Protection System

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want my premium images, textures, and 3D models protected from direct download, so that users cannot right-click and save my valuable assets.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN user requests asset THEN system SHALL serve time-limited signed URLs (5-15 minutes expiration)
2. WHEN asset URL expires THEN direct access SHALL return 403/404 error
3. WHEN user browses application THEN high-resolution assets SHALL only load when specifically needed
4. WHEN asset is served THEN URL SHALL use random tokens instead of descriptive filenames
5. WHEN user attempts direct folder access THEN system SHALL return 403/404 errors

#### Success Metrics
- Asset URLs expire within 15 minutes maximum
- Direct asset download attempts fail >95% of the time
- Asset discovery requires specialized tools

### Requirement 3: API Endpoint Obfuscation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want my API endpoints and data structures to be non-discoverable, so that attackers cannot map my backend architecture or understand my data model.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN API calls are made THEN endpoints SHALL use non-obvious paths (e.g., `/a7f3d` instead of `/api/saints`)
2. WHEN JSON responses are sent THEN field names SHALL be shortened/obfuscated
3. WHEN API is accessed THEN rate limiting SHALL prevent automated discovery
4. WHEN cross-origin requests occur THEN CORS headers SHALL restrict access to authorized domains only
5. WHEN large datasets are requested THEN responses SHALL be paginated and require authentication

#### Success Metrics
- API endpoint discovery time increases to >10 minutes for experts
- Data structure understanding requires >30 minutes of analysis
- Automated scraping attempts blocked >98% of the time

### Requirement 4: Runtime Security Monitoring

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to detect and respond to reverse engineering attempts, so that I can monitor threats and maintain application integrity.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN user opens browser dev tools THEN system SHALL detect the event and log it
2. WHEN dev tools are detected THEN user SHALL see warning message discouraging inspection
3. WHEN code tampering is detected THEN system SHALL trigger security alerts
4. WHEN JavaScript files load THEN integrity hashes SHALL be verified
5. WHEN security events occur THEN system SHALL log events for analysis

#### Success Metrics
- Dev tools detection accuracy >95%
- Code integrity verification completes in <100ms
- Security event logging captures >99% of relevant events

## üìä NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

### Performance Requirements

#### Requirement 5: Minimal Performance Impact
**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to remain fast and responsive, so that security measures don't degrade my experience.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN obfuscation is applied THEN bundle size increase SHALL be <10%
2. WHEN asset protection is active THEN initial page load delay SHALL be <500ms
3. WHEN security verification runs THEN memory usage increase SHALL be <5%
4. WHEN protection measures execute THEN application response time SHALL remain <200ms

### Compatibility Requirements

#### Requirement 6: Browser Support
**User Story:** As a user on any modern browser, I want the application to work correctly, so that security measures don't break functionality.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN protection measures are active THEN application SHALL work on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
2. WHEN older browsers access application THEN protection SHALL degrade gracefully
3. WHEN mobile devices access application THEN performance SHALL remain optimal
4. WHEN accessibility tools are used THEN protection SHALL NOT interfere with screen readers

## üîó Relationship to Generic Requirements Framework

This document follows the spec-driven development methodology by:

- **User-Centered**: All requirements written from user perspective (developer, business owner, content creator)
- **Testable**: Each requirement includes measurable acceptance criteria using WHEN/THEN format
- **Complete**: Covers functional, non-functional, performance, and compatibility requirements
- **Prioritized**: Clear must-have/should-have/could-have categorization
- **Traceable**: Links user needs to specific implementation phases

The relationship is: **Generic methodology ‚Üí Specific application**. This requirements document serves as the practical implementation of requirements engineering best practices for the specific domain of web application security and code protection.
