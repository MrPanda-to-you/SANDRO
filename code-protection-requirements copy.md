# üîí Code Protection & Asset Security Requirements

**Purpose**: Protect web application code, assets, and business logic from easy discovery and replication  
**Context**: Currently everything is discoverable via browser dev tools (F12) - library names, file paths, API endpoints, textures, etc.  
**Goal**: Make the application harder to reverse-engineer and copy

---

## üéØ **CORE OBJECTIVES**

**As a developer**, I want to protect my intellectual property so that competitors cannot easily steal or replicate my work.

**As a business owner**, I want to make it difficult for others to copy my unique features and assets so that I maintain competitive advantage.

**As a content creator**, I want to protect my premium assets (images, 3D models, textures) so that they cannot be easily downloaded and reused.

## üìã **USER STORIES**

### **üîê JavaScript Code Protection**

**Story 1: Hide Library Names and File Paths**
- **As a developer**, I want my JavaScript bundle file names to be obfuscated
- **So that** attackers cannot easily identify what libraries I'm using
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Bundle files have randomized names (e.g., `a7d82f.js` instead of `unicornStudio.umd.js`)
  - Library names don't appear in console logs or network requests
  - Source file structure is not visible in browser dev tools

**Story 2: Remove Debug Information**
- **As a developer**, I want all console.log statements and debug info removed from production
- **So that** my application logic and configuration objects are not exposed
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - No scene IDs, configuration objects, or debug info in browser console
  - All console.log, console.warn, console.debug statements stripped
  - Error messages are generic and don't reveal internal structure

**Story 3: Obfuscate JavaScript Code**
- **As a developer**, I want my JavaScript code to be unreadable when viewed in browser dev tools
- **So that** my business logic and algorithms cannot be easily copied
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Variable names are mangled (e.g., `a`, `b`, `c` instead of meaningful names)
  - Function names are obfuscated
  - Control flow is obfuscated to make reverse engineering difficult
  - Dead code injection makes the code harder to understand

**Story 4: Disable Source Maps in Production**
- **As a developer**, I want source maps completely disabled in production builds
- **So that** the original source code structure is not accessible
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - No `.map` files generated or served in production
  - Browser dev tools cannot show original source file structure
  - "Sources" tab in dev tools only shows minified code

### **üñºÔ∏è Asset Protection**

**Story 5: Protect High-Value Images and Textures**
- **As a content creator**, I want my premium images/textures protected from direct download
- **So that** users cannot right-click ‚Üí save my valuable assets
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Images served through time-limited signed URLs
  - High-resolution assets are only served when needed
  - Watermarked or lower-quality versions for general browsing
  - Image URLs expire after short time periods (5-15 minutes)

**Story 6: Hide Asset File Paths**
- **As a developer**, I want asset URLs to be non-obvious and temporary
- **So that** users cannot guess or bookmark direct asset links
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Asset URLs use random tokens instead of descriptive filenames
  - URLs include expiration timestamps
  - Direct access to asset folders returns 403/404 errors
  - Assets served through proxy/CDN with custom headers

**Story 7: Protect 3D Models and Shader Code**
- **As a developer**, I want my 3D models and shader code protected from extraction
- **So that** my unique visual effects cannot be easily replicated
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Shader code is minified and obfuscated
  - 3D models are served in optimized/compressed formats
  - Original high-quality models remain on secure server
  - Shader code loaded as base64 blobs or encrypted strings

### **üåê Network and API Protection**

**Story 8: Hide API Endpoints and Structure**
- **As a developer**, I want my API endpoints to be non-discoverable
- **So that** attackers cannot map my backend architecture
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - API endpoints use non-obvious paths (e.g., `/a7f3d` instead of `/api/saints`)
  - API versioning is hidden or obfuscated
  - Rate limiting prevents automated discovery
  - CORS headers restrict access to authorized domains only

**Story 9: Protect Data Structures**
- **As a developer**, I want my data formats and structures to be non-obvious
- **So that** competitors cannot easily understand my data model
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - JSON responses use shortened/obfuscated field names
  - Large datasets are paginated and require authentication
  - Sensitive data is encrypted before transmission
  - Response formats vary to prevent easy parsing

### **‚ö° Build Process and Deployment**

**Story 10: Automated Production Hardening**
- **As a developer**, I want my build process to automatically apply all security measures
- **So that** I don't accidentally deploy unprotected code
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Build process automatically minifies all JavaScript
  - Console statements are stripped in production builds
  - Source maps are excluded from production deployments
  - Asset fingerprinting creates unique file names for each build

**Story 11: Environment-Based Configuration**
- **As a developer**, I want different security levels for different environments
- **So that** I can debug in development but lock down production
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Development builds include source maps and console logs
  - Staging builds have partial protection for testing
  - Production builds have maximum protection enabled
  - Environment variables control protection levels

### **üõ°Ô∏è Runtime Protection**

**Story 12: Detect and Respond to Dev Tools**
- **As a developer**, I want to detect when someone opens browser dev tools
- **So that** I can respond appropriately to potential reverse engineering attempts
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Application detects when dev tools are opened
  - Warning message displayed to discourage inspection
  - Optional: reduce functionality or redirect when dev tools detected
  - Logging of dev tools usage for security monitoring

**Story 13: Code Integrity Verification**
- **As a developer**, I want to verify my code hasn't been tampered with
- **So that** I can ensure the application runs as intended
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - JavaScript files include integrity hashes
  - Code verification runs at startup
  - Modified code triggers security alerts
  - Fallback to secure versions if tampering detected

### **üìä Monitoring and Analytics**

**Story 14: Security Event Logging**
- **As a developer**, I want to track potential security threats and reverse engineering attempts
- **So that** I can improve my protection measures over time
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Log dev tools usage patterns
  - Track failed asset access attempts
  - Monitor for automated scraping behavior
  - Analytics on protection effectiveness

**Story 15: Performance Impact Monitoring**
- **As a developer**, I want to ensure security measures don't significantly impact performance
- **So that** user experience remains excellent while maintaining protection
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Obfuscation adds <5% to bundle size
  - Asset protection doesn't delay loading >200ms
  - Monitoring dashboard shows protection vs performance metrics
  - A/B testing to optimize protection/performance balance
