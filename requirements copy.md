Function of requirements.md in Spec-Driven Development (Generic)
The requirements.md file serves as the foundational specification that defines what needs to be built from the user's perspective. Here's its generic function:

ðŸŽ¯ Core Purpose
Capture and formalize user needs, business objectives, and system behaviors in a structured, testable format that guides all subsequent development decisions.

ðŸ“‹ Primary Functions
1. Stakeholder Communication
Common Language: Provides shared understanding between business, design, and development teams
Expectation Setting: Clearly defines what the system will and won't do
Decision Documentation: Records key decisions and trade-offs made during planning
2. Scope Definition
Boundary Setting: Establishes clear limits on feature scope and functionality
Priority Framework: Identifies must-have vs. nice-to-have features
Success Criteria: Defines measurable outcomes for feature acceptance
3. Design Foundation
User-Centered Focus: Ensures technical decisions serve actual user needs
Behavior Specification: Defines how the system should respond to user actions
Quality Standards: Establishes non-functional requirements (performance, accessibility, security)
4. Validation Framework
Acceptance Criteria: Provides testable conditions for feature completion
Quality Gates: Defines standards that must be met before release
Traceability: Enables tracking from user need to implemented solution

Input Sources
User Research: Pain points, workflows, and desired outcomes
Business Goals: Strategic objectives and success metrics
Technical Constraints: Platform limitations, compliance needs, performance targets
Output Deliverables
Functional Requirements: What the system must do
Non-Functional Requirements: How well the system must perform
Acceptance Criteria: Testable conditions for completion
ðŸŽ¯ Typical Structure
Introduction Section
Problem Statement: Why this feature is needed
Target Users: Who will benefit from this feature
Success Vision: What success looks like
Requirements Format
### Requirement X: [Feature Name]

**User Story:** As a [role], I want [feature], so that [benefit]

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN [condition] THEN [system] SHALL [response]
2. IF [precondition] THEN [system] SHALL [behavior]
3. GIVEN [context] WHEN [action] THEN [outcome]
Common Categories
Functional Requirements: Core features and behaviors
Usability Requirements: User experience and interface needs
Performance Requirements: Speed, scalability, and efficiency targets
Accessibility Requirements: Inclusive design and compliance standards
Security Requirements: Data protection and privacy needs
âœ… Quality Characteristics
EARS Format (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax)
WHEN/IF/GIVEN: Establishes clear conditions
THEN/SHALL: Defines expected system response
Testable: Each requirement can be validated
User-Centered
User Stories: Written from user perspective
Value-Focused: Explains why each feature matters
Outcome-Oriented: Focuses on user benefits, not technical implementation
Complete and Consistent
Comprehensive Coverage: Addresses all aspects of the feature
Non-Contradictory: Requirements don't conflict with each other
Prioritized: Clear indication of what's essential vs. optional
ðŸ“Š Success Metrics
Quantifiable Targets
Performance Benchmarks: Load times, response rates, throughput
Usability Metrics: Task completion rates, error frequencies, satisfaction scores
Quality Standards: Accessibility compliance, security ratings, reliability measures
Validation Criteria
Acceptance Thresholds: Minimum acceptable performance levels
Testing Requirements: How each requirement will be verified
Success Indicators: Measurable outcomes that indicate feature success
ðŸ”§ For Development Teams
The requirements.md enables:

Focused Development
Clear understanding of user needs and priorities
Objective criteria for feature completion
Guidance for making implementation trade-offs
Quality Assurance
Testable acceptance criteria for validation
Performance and accessibility standards
Clear definition of "done"
Stakeholder Alignment
Shared understanding of feature scope and goals
Documented decisions and rationale
Framework for evaluating proposed changes
ðŸ“ˆ Benefits
Risk Reduction
Prevents scope creep and feature drift
Identifies potential issues early in development
Provides objective criteria for acceptance
Efficiency
Reduces rework by clarifying expectations upfront
Enables parallel work on design and planning
Streamlines testing and validation processes
Quality
Ensures user needs drive technical decisions
Establishes quality standards from the beginning
Provides framework for continuous improvement
ðŸŽ¯ Key Principles
User-Centric
Written from user perspective, not system perspective
Focuses on outcomes and benefits, not features
Considers diverse user needs and scenarios
Testable
Each requirement can be objectively verified
Clear pass/fail criteria for acceptance
Measurable success indicators
Complete
Covers all aspects of the feature
Addresses edge cases and error scenarios
Includes non-functional requirements
The requirements.md serves as the north star for the entire development process, ensuring that all technical decisions and implementation work ultimately serve real user needs and deliver measurable value.
